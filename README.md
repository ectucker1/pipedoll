# PipeDoll

PipeDoll is a motion capture animation plugin for the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
It uses [Google's MediaPipe library](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) to capture motion data using a standard webcam.

The plugin is still in early development and is not yet suitable for use.
